# datascience

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of the package datascience is to support the readers of the book "Data Science und Statistik" with samples, functions and tutorials as described in the book.

## Installation

You can install the released version of datascience from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bheesen/datascience")
library(datascience)
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to call one of the tutorials:

```{r tutorial}
tutorial(name = "Tutorial-R-1")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r studierende}
descriptive(studierende$Größe, "Körpergröße (in cm)")
```

The `README.Rmd` file was used to create the `README.md` file using the function `devtools::build_readme()`.
